# The comments above are not just comments. Discourse will parse them for the plugin name etc.

# Declare that one of the things in config/settings.yml turns the whole plugin on and off.
# Discourse uses this for the Enabled Y/N field. It's up to us to check it in our code as well.

# We need to tell Discourse which FontAwesome icons we want to use, so they are available.
# The icon itself is used within assets/javascripts/discourse/initializers/discourse-reset-bump.js.es6

# after_initialize is a callback that happens after this ruby file has been loaded. I'm not sure

  # A controller is how the client-side javascript code communicates with the sever-side
  # Ruby on Rails code. Once everything is hooked up, there will be a URL which results
  # in our controller being called, and returning something that might be displayed to
  # the user or consumed by client-side code (e.g. a success/failure indicator).
  # This is the best guide I could find, although it is about modifying Discourse itself
  # and not about writing plugins, so not everything is completely applicable:

    # The Admin::AdminController mentioned in "Creating Routes in Discourse and Showing Data"

    # built-in, and an "index" method that returns nothing. I'm not sure if we should use 
    # Admin::AdminController from a plugin (other plugins I looked at don't) and I only worked
    # out how to after I had already tested things, so I'm sticking with how it is. But here
    # is how you would use Admin::AdminController instead if you wanted to:
    #
    # require_dependency 'admin/admin_controller'
    # class DiscourseResetBump::ResetBumpController < Admin::AdminController
    #   ...then don't bother with the before_action lines, and the rest is then as it is now.

    # if it is actually important or not. I just copied it.

    # "bump" is our main method, and may end up being the only one we need.
    def bump

      # params[:post_id].to_i would return 0 if the param was missing, so this is a bit redundant
      # but a good habit for when zero is a valid input that we need to separate from a missing param.

      # I'd like to wrap everything in a transaction so it is atomic...
      # ...but I don't understand Rails transactions well enough. :-) It's not super important in this case.

      # There are probably better ways but I learnt how the Post, Topic, etc. objects fit together by
      # looking at the database tables, then finding out there are Ruby on Rails objects which map
      # directly to them. If you open the Rails Console ("rails c" in Linux's Vagrant or Discourse dir)
      # you can type e.g. Post to get into about the Post object, and Post.find(1) to output the post
      # with ID=1, Post.find(1).topic_id to get the topid ID, etc. Makes things easy to find and play
      # with. Finding the source for each file can also help
      # e.g. https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/app/models/topic.rb

      # There is also last_posted_at but I think it makes sense to leave that alone.
      # Arguably, we could take the last non-deleted post and use that for the last_post_user_id and last_posted_at
      # while only taking the selected post's bump time, but it depends exactly what the admin's intent is. My
      # personal needs are to reset the thread to the last (possibly only) post after edits to correct formatting,
      # or I'll want to stop someone's gratuitous bump from pushing a thread to the front page. So bumped_at makes
      # sense in both cases. I'd also like to be able to fix the problem where delete, then undelete, of the last
      # post doesn't fix the last_post_user_id and avatar shown in the Lastest page back to the undeleted post's
      # author. So I want to update last_post_user_id but I don't really care if it's to the selected post or the
      # last post as they'll usually be the same for me, unless I'm trying to bury someone's post in which case
      # I don't really care if their face is hidden from lower down the Latest list or not; for now, it will be.
